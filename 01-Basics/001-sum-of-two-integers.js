// Before adding two integers ,we need to know Waht is an integer?
// An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. It does not include fractions or decimals.
// Examples of integers: -3, 0, 7, 42, 192, 69 any no. without a decimal point.

// Examples of non-integers: 3.5, -2.1, 0.75, 1/2, 4.0 

//! Now, let's see how to add two integers in JavaScript.

let a = 12;
let b = 87;

console.log(a + b);

//It is as simple as that!

// In this example, we have two integers, 12 and 87. We use the + operator to add them together, and the result is 99.
// You can replace the values of a and b with any other integers to find their sum.
